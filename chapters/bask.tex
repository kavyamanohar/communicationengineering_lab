\section*{Aim}
To set-up and implement circuits to carry out Binary Amplitude Shift Keying (BASK). To design demodulationg circuits to detect the message from BASK modulated wave.
\section*{Theory}

Binary Amplitude Shift Keying or ON-OFF Keying is the simplest digital modulation technique. In this method there is only one unit energy carrier and it is switched on or off depending upon the input binary sequence.

The BASK waveform may be represented as:

$ s(t) = \sqrt{2P_s} cos (2\pi f_ct) $, to transmit a symbol '1'.

To transmit a symbol '0' the signal $ s(t) =0 $ is transmitted. 

The signal $s(t)$ contains some complete cycles of carrier frequency $f_c$. The BASK waveform looks like an On and Off of the signal. Therefore it isalso known as ON-OFF Keying. See sample waveforms in Figure \ref{baskmod}

\section*{Design}
\subsection*{BASK Generation}

BASK signal may be generated by simply applying the incoming binary data and sinusoidal carrier to the two inputs of an analog switch. When the binary data is applied to the control input of the switch, resulting output will be a BASK waveform. Ensure the carrier frequency is higher compared to the binary data frequency. 


\subsection*{BASK Demodulation}

Binary ASK signal can be demodulated non-coherantly using an envelop detector. This greatly simplifies the design cnsiderations required in synchronous detection. Non-coherant detection schemes  do not require a phase coherant local oscillator. 

\noindent Use 0A79 diode and $1 k\Omega $ resistor for rectification.
\noindent Use a simple RC lowpass filter to pass the low frequency binary message. Assuming the message frequecny is less than $1.5 kHz$,
 
\begin{equation}
f_H=\frac{1}{2\pi R_dC_d}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
1.5\ kHz=\frac{1}{2\pi R_dC_d}
\end{equation}
\noindent Select $C_d=\ 0.1 \mu F$. Then $R_d=\ 1k\Omega$.
Choose $R_d=\ 1k\Omega$ standard resistor value.\\

The resulting sequency may not be a perfect binary square wave. It can be transformed to a perfect binary sequence by using a threshold detector. The threshold level may adjusted using a $5 k\Omega$ pot.
